# Caf√© Analog Indicator for Emacs #

The `analog-indicator-mode` displays a little üçµ in the Emacs mode line whenever [Caf√© Analog](http://cafeanalog.dk) at the IT University of Copenhagen is open.

If you spend your entire working day in Emacs anyway, why bother checking on the Analog's web site? This nifty minor mode simply queries the Analog web API ~~as often as you'd like~~ every ten minutes or so ~~and even tells you when Analog is about to close~~.

I expect that this is soon going to be a useful tool for all ITU students and employees who use the correct text editor.

## Planned Features ##

- [x] Interval based updates of opening status.
- [ ] Three-level indicator in Emacs' mode line: Open, Closed, Closes soon.
- [ ] Customizable frequency of status checks.
